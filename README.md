# Bug Hunting and Cybersecurity Roadmap

## 1. OWASP Top 10 and Web Recon
The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. Understanding and applying these vulnerabilities is the first step toward bug hunting.

### How to Get Started:
- Visit the [OWASP Official Website](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to learn the basics.
- Study and watch tutorials for each vulnerability, such as:
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - SQL Injection
  - Command Injection
  - Broken Access Control

### Web Recon Tools:
Reconnaissance is the initial phase of collecting information about a target. Popular tools include:
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Amass, Subfinder
- **Port Scanning:** Nmap
- **Directory Brute Forcing:** Dirbuster, Gobuster
- **HTTP Request Analysis:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

## 2. Learn XSS, SQL Injection, HTML Injection, and Command Injection
Each attack type and method is unique. Below are guidelines to learn them effectively:

### **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
- Learn how XSS injects scripts into websites and steals user data.
- **Tools:** Burp Suite, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- **Practice Platforms:** [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)

### **SQL Injection:**
- Use malicious SQL queries to access or extract data from databases.
- **Tools:** SQLmap
- **Practice Platforms:** HackTheBox, PentesterLab

### **HTML Injection:**
- Manipulate HTML content for phishing or clickjacking attacks.
- **Live Practice:** DVWA, HackThisSite

### **Command Injection:**
- Exploit application command execution processes to gain server access.
- **Tools:** ExploitDB, OWASP Juice Shop

## 3. Join Bug Bounty Platforms
Participate in bug bounty programs on the following websites:
- [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/)
- [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)
- [YesWeHack](https://www.yeswehack.com/)

### How to Start:
1. Begin with smaller programs or less competitive bug bounty projects.
2. Analyze reports on LinkedIn or HackerOne’s Top Bug Reports.
3. Explore the "Hall of Fame" section to study bug hunters’ successful reports.

---

## 4. Build Your Network and Community
- **LinkedIn and Twitter:** Stay active and learn from bug hunters’ posts and reports.
- **Join Communities:** Engage in Discord or Slack communities focused on bug bounty and cybersecurity.

---

## 5. Plan Your Professional Path
Bug hunting is a skill. Instead of relying solely on it as a career, explore role-based jobs for stability:
- Penetration Tester
- Cybersecurity Analyst
- Application Security Engineer
- Web3 Security Specialist

---

## Extra Tips:
- Regularly study and expand your knowledge base.
- Focus on improving **Critical Thinking** and **Problem-Solving Skills**.
- Spend time on platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and CTF competitions.

**Success depends on dedication, knowledge, and critical thinking!**
